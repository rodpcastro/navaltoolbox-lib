## Installation

```bash
pip install navaltoolbox
```

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.9 or higher
- No additional dependencies required (all native code included in wheels)

## Quick Start

### Loading a Hull

```python
from navaltoolbox import Hull

# Load hull from STL file
hull = Hull("ship.stl")

# Get hull dimensions
bounds = hull.get_bounds()
loa = bounds[1] - bounds[0]  # Length overall
boa = bounds[3] - bounds[2]  # Beam overall

print(f"LOA: {loa:.2f}m, BOA: {boa:.2f}m")
print(f"Triangles: {hull.num_triangles()}")
```

### Hydrostatics Calculation

```python
from navaltoolbox import Hull, Vessel, HydrostaticsCalculator

# Create vessel
hull = Hull("ship.stl")
vessel = Vessel(hull)

# Calculate hydrostatics at a given draft
calc = HydrostaticsCalculator(vessel, water_density=1025.0)

# Option 1: At draft with VCG (computes stability)
state = calc.from_draft(draft=5.0, vcg=7.0)

print(f"Volume: {state.volume:.1f} m³")
print(f"Displacement: {state.displacement:.0f} kg")
print(f"COB: ({state.cob[0]:.2f}, {state.cob[1]:.2f}, {state.cob[2]:.2f})")
print(f"Waterplane Area: {state.waterplane_area:.1f} m²")
print(f"LCF: {state.lcf:.2f} m")
print(f"GMT (wet): {state.gmt:.3f} m")
print(f"GMT (dry): {state.gmt_dry:.3f} m")

# Option 2: Find draft for displacement
state_disp = calc.from_displacement(512500.0)
print(f"Draft for {state_disp.displacement:.0f}kg: {state_disp.draft:.3f} m")
```

### Stability Analysis (GZ Curve)

```python
from navaltoolbox import Hull, Vessel, StabilityCalculator

# Create vessel and calculator
hull = Hull("ship.stl")
vessel = Vessel(hull)
calc = StabilityCalculator(vessel, water_density=1025.0)

# Calculate GZ curve
displacement_mass = 8635000.0  # kg
cog = (71.67, 0.0, 7.555)      # LCG, TCG, VCG in meters
heels = [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]

curve = calc.gz_curve(displacement_mass, cog, heels)

# Display results
print("Heel (°)  |  GZ (m)")
print("-" * 25)
for heel, gz in zip(curve.heels(), curve.values()):
    print(f"{heel:7.1f}  |  {gz:7.3f}")

# Get max GZ
gz_values = curve.values()
max_gz = max(gz_values)
max_idx = gz_values.index(max_gz)
max_heel = heels[max_idx]
print(f"\nMax GZ: {max_gz:.3f}m at {max_heel}°")
```

### Loading Conditions

```python
from navaltoolbox import Hull, Vessel, Tank, LoadingCondition, MassCategory

# Create vessel with a tank
vessel = Vessel(Hull("ship.stl"))
vessel.add_tank(Tank.from_box("FO_1", 20.0, 30.0, -5.0, 5.0, 0.0, 2.0, 1000.0))

# Define loading condition
lc = LoadingCondition("Arrival")
lc.add_mass_simple("Lightship", 5000000.0, (40.0, 0.0, 5.0), MassCategory.lightship())
lc.set_tank_fill_percent("FO_1", 50.0)

# Apply and resolve
lc.apply(vessel)
disp, cog = lc.resolve(vessel)
item_disp, item_cog = lc.resolve_items()

print(f"Total Combined Displacement: {disp:.0f} kg")
print(f"Combined COG: {cog}")
print(f"Solid items only: {item_disp:.0f} kg at {item_cog}")

# Use item_disp and item_cog for stability calculations
# as the StabilityCalculator handles tanks intrinsically.
```
