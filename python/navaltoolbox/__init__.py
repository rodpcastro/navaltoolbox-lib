NavalToolbox - High-performance naval architecture library.

This library provides tools for hydrostatics, stability analysis,
and tank management in naval architecture applications.

Classes:
    Hull: A hull geometry loaded from an STL file.
    Vessel: A vessel containing hulls, tanks, and silhouettes.
    Silhouette: A 2D profile for wind heeling calculations.
    Tank: A tank with fluid management capabilities.
    HydrostaticsCalculator: Calculator for hydrostatic properties.
    StabilityCalculator: Calculator for stability curves (GZ).
    DownfloodingOpening: Openings for downflooding analysis.
    OpeningType: Types of downflooding openings.

Example:
    >>> from navaltoolbox import Hull, Vessel, HydrostaticsCalculator
    >>> hull = Hull("ship.stl")
    >>> vessel = Vessel(hull)
    >>> calc = HydrostaticsCalculator(vessel)
    >>> state = calc.from_draft(5.0)
    >>> print(f"Displacement: {state.displacement:.0f} kg")
