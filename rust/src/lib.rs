//! # NavalToolbox
//!
//! High-performance naval architecture library for hydrostatics, stability, and tank calculations.
//!
//! ## Features
//! - Hull geometry loading (STL, VTK)
//! - Multi-hull vessel support
//! - Hydrostatic calculations (volume, CoB, waterplane properties, metacentric heights)
//! - Stability analysis (KN curves, GZ curves)
//! - Tank management with free surface effects
//!
//! ## Usage
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use navaltoolbox::{Hull, Vessel, HydrostaticsCalculator};
//!
//! let hull = Hull::from_stl("ship.stl")?;
//! let vessel = Vessel::new(hull);
//! let calc = HydrostaticsCalculator::new(&vessel, 1025.0);
//! let state = calc.from_draft(5.0, 0.0, 0.0)?;
//! println!("Volume: {} m³", state.volume);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Disclaimer
//!
//! NavalToolbox has been developed with care to ensure that all models and methods are correct.
//! However, **results must not be considered as a guarantee of performance**. The author cannot
//! be held responsible for any inaccuracies in the calculations or for any consequences arising
//! from the use of this software. Users are advised to independently verify critical calculations
//! and to use this software as a tool to support, not replace, professional engineering judgment.
